    <p>
      Here's a medley of 20 skills to help you become a design expert, no matter

        Being a web designer involves harmoniously combining visuals and
        content. But non-technical skills, like collaboration and communication,
        are also important.

      You don’t need to know music theory to write a song, and if you’ve never
      taken an art class, you can still draw. Some of us might have an innate
      artistic ability, but knowing the basic fundamentals can make the
      difference between recreating what you see and being able to build a
      design that’s calculated and unique.

      “<a href="#">Essential visual design principles</a>” does a deeper dive
      into the principles of visual design rooted in Gestalt psychology. These
      fundamentals are the foundation of web and graphic design and important to
      know. Whether you’re designing a portfolio or a print ad, these concepts
      can help guide your work. Let’s do a quick recap.
    </p>
    <span class="lead">Emergence</span>
    <p>
      Rather than focusing on individual parts, we tend to process visual
      stimuli as a whole. Emergence is seeing an arrangement of visuals and
      immediately understanding what they represent. When something breaks a
      pattern, we become aware of the pieces that make it up.
    </p>
    <span class="lead">Reification</span>
    <p>
      Reification is using only the essential parts of an object to make it
      identifiable. It lets you exercise restraint in a design, while still
      conveying meaning.
    </p>
    <span class="lead">Invariance</span>
    <p>
      Invariance is being able to use tasteful discordance in your designs,
      making something stand out from a group of similar objects. The use of
      invariance allows you to highlight parts of a design.
    </p>
    <h6 class="mt-lg-5">2. Typography</h6>
    <img :src="'images/blogd02.jpg'" alt="Image" class="img-fluid" />
    <p>
      Typography shapes our perception of ideas. A type’s weight and geometry
      communicates meaning, and as a designer, it’s important to know the best
      way to deliver messaging with the appropriate typographical choices.
    </p>

    <p>
      All the font options can make it hard for new designers to know what to
      choose. Practical fonts like Georgia, Verdana, and Roboto work well for
      body copy, while more decorative typefaces should be used sparingly as
      ornamentation. Good designers know the difference between type styles and
      where to use them.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are plenty of resources on the web to help broaden your typographic
      knowledge.
      <a href="#" class="text-decoration-underline">FONTS IN USE</a> shows
      different typefaces applied to a variety of media. Tools like
      <a href="#" class="text-decoration-underline"
        >Font combinations for web designers</a
      >
      can give you ideas for possible pairings.
